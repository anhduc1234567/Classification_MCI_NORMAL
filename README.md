# 🧠 EEG-Based Deep Learning for MCI vs. Normal Classification

This project utilizes EEG data to train deep learning models for distinguishing between **MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment)** and **Normal** subjects using two approaches:

- **Spectrogram-based features**
- **Raw EEG data**

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Training and Process data/`  
  Contains code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- `Feature extraction/`  
  Includes code for extracting features from EEG signals, such as spectrograms and other derived representations.

## 📂 Preprocessed Dataset

The processed EEG dataset is available here:
